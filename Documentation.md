# Glass Manufacturing Factory System Documentation

## Project Overview

### Project Idea
The project involves managing a glass manufacturing factory with multiple departments, including decoration, car glasses, and glasses for buildings. Different user roles are defined, each with varying permissions and access levels.

## User Roles

### Manager Levels (Admin Dashboard)
1. **Super Manager (Admin)**
   - Has access to all system tables and can perform all actions.
   - Can access data from all factory branches.

2. **Branch Manager**
   - Access is limited to their specific branch, e.g., Assiut Branch Manager has access only to the Assiut factory branch.
   - Access is determined based on location data retrieved from Google Analytics.

3. **Employee**
   - Employees have varying roles and permissions.

### Customer Roles
1. **Engineering Office Manager**
   - Can request glass materials for specific buildings.

2. **Dealer of Glass Material**
   - Can request a large quantity of glass from the factory.

3. **Normal Customer**
   - Typically requests a small number of products.
   - Has access to customer support features, including a chat interface for contacting factory staff or customer service.
   - Supports redirection to WhatsApp and Messenger chats.
   - Can submit product requests with customer information (email, phone number, requested product, full name, closest branch).
   - Payment is not supported online; payment can only be made at the branch.

## System Requirements

### 1. Factory Products
- Each product belongs to a category (e.g., car glasses, glasses for buildings).
- Each product undergoes multiple stages of production.
- The user responsible for identifying production stages varies based on manager levels.
- Customers can view the production stages of their owned or purchased products.
- Products have a virtual, estimated, or approximate price (accessible to employees and manager levels) and an actual selling price (the final price for customers).

### 2. Categories
- Customers can review available product categories and products within each category.

### 3. Personal Account Management
- Users can manage their personal accounts and account settings.

### 4. Payment
- Payment is allowed for customer-level users (Engineering Office Manager, Dealer of Glass Material, Normal Customer).
- Payment can only be made at the branch.

### 5. Analytics in Admin Dashboard
- The admin dashboard provides analytics including:
   - Customer login locations.
   - Branch with the most customers.
   - Government with the most customers.
   - Most requested product.
   - Most requested category.
   - Top customer roles (e.g., Engineering Office Managers, Dealers) requesting products.
   - Customizable criteria for the analytics.
